CSC 435 assignment 4 - by peter chepelev

This is a compiler for a small language. The compiler is constructed as a Java program, where a large fraction of the code for the compiler's front-end is automatically generated by the antlr tool. The compiler will use a stack-based Intermediate Representation (IR) and that IR will be translated into Java Virtual Machine (JVM) bytecode. 

to compile, run make

to generate .j files:
java Compiler <sourcecode filename> > <output .j filename>

(output must be piped into a new file via command line)

Tests are in Tests/a3, there are four test cases i wrote there.
